= Fix for WordPress 4.4 issue =

Starting Shortcoder 3.4.1 the syntax for shortcoder is [sc name="your shortcode"]. This is in effect to the shortcode API related changes made in WordPress core which made old the syntax unrecognizable. Version 3.4.1 automatically recognizes the old syntax only in posts where the shortcode is inserted directly and not in widgets or in drag and drop themes modules. Those areas need to be manually replaced from old `[sc:my_shortcode]` to the new `[sc name="my_shortcode"]` syntax. Please use the below resources for any queries.
