Easily add custom CSS and Javascript code to your WordPress site, with draft previewing, revisions, and minification!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add custom site-wide CSS styles and Javascript code to your WordPress site. Useful for overriding your theme's styles and adding client-side functionality.

Features:

* Code editor with syntax highlighting and AJAX saving to avoid reloading the editor at each save.
* Save and preview your CSS and Javascript as a draft that is only applied to logged-in users with the necessary permissions until you are ready to publish your changes to the public.
* View and restore past revisions of your CSS and Javascript.
* Automatically minify your custom CSS and Jasascript code to reduce file size.
* For the public, custom CSS and Javascript code is served from the filesystem instead of the database for optimal performance.

Now available! [Custom CSS and Javascript Developer Edition](https://potentplugins.com/downloads/custom-css-javascript-developer-edition/?utm_source=custom-css-and-javascript&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wp-repo-upgrade-link):

* Divide your CSS and Javascript into multiple virtual files to keep your code organized (the code is still served as one CSS and one JS file on the front-end for efficiency).
* Supports Sassy CSS (SCSS)!
* Live preview for CSS!
* Upload and download CSS and Javascript files, individually or in ZIP files.
* The developer logo and review/donation links are removed from the editor page in the WordPress admin.
